This is the project repository for my personal website. I've build and rebuilt my personal website
in many technologies, but these days it is a simple TypeScript React SPA. Before using TS, I put
Flow up to the same task and was pleasantly surprised, but ultimately won over in other projects by
TS.

The site is currently hosted on S3 and cached/distributed around the US by Cloudfront. The site is
also continuously deployed using TravisCI.

You can read more about my other projects [here](https://mjfs.us/projects).
